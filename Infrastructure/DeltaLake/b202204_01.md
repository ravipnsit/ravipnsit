Building Feature Store on Lakehouse Architecture
----------------------------------------------

Today, I would like to share our story of building our Machine Learning Pipeline's Feature Store to popular, open-source
lakehouse architecture based storage,
[delta lake](https://delta.io/)

First brief context on our existing structure.

As evident through above diagram, we were dependent on using Relational Database, Postgres, as our primary feature store
